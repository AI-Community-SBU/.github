## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The goal of the AI Community is to create a setting where students of different backgrounds may learn about and pursue their interests in artificial intelligence. To help students grasp the theories and gain practical experience creating their own ML projects, we offer workshops, paper reading sessions, and machine learning (ML) projects. We'll invite experts to speak as special guests and give students the chance to test cutting-edge AI tools by competing in ML competitions.

<!-- **Creativity! Innovation! Collaboration!** -->
